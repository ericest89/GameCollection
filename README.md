# GameCollection
The main purpose of this project is to try to understand how to call on other classes but in this point it will be a menu calling other games. Working on the drop down menu will be the most important and the longest to complete if possible
The project as been split to each individual having to build the code for their assigned game and from there we will interact with it on GitHub and via email. 
Most of the games are the basic games you can find that involve just enough complexity to give a challenge while also trying to reduce the redundancy of it.
Lopez is working on tic tac toe
DeBruler is working on hangman.
Estrada is working on the menu and RPSLS game which is rock, paper, scissors, Spock.

The games are going to be simple and almost basic with minimum graphics do to limited equipment and time. The whole purpose of the project is to show the basic understanding of coding with java.
